{\ttfamily mod\+\_\+lua} version of the \hyperlink{namespaceApache}{Apache} httpd\textquotesingle{}s mod\+\_\+status using dynamic charts

\subsection*{What does it do?}

This script is an extended version of the known mod\+\_\+status statistics page for httpd. It uses the simple Quokka Chart A\+PI to visualize many of the elements that are sometimes hard to properly diagnose using plain text information.

Take a look at \href{https://www.apache.org/server-status}{\tt https\+://www.\+apache.\+org/server-\/status} to see how it works.

\subsection*{Requirements}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{namespaceApache}{Apache} httpd 2.\+4.\+6 or higher
\item mod\+\_\+lua (with either Lua 5.\+1, 5.\+2 or Lua\+J\+IT)
\item mod\+\_\+status loaded (for enabling traffic statistics)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Installing}

First, install mod\+\_\+lua (you can enable this during configure time with --enable-\/lua)

\subsubsection*{Installing as a handler\+:}

To install it as a handler, add the following to your httpd.\+conf in the appropriate Virtual\+Host\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}LuaMapHandler ^/server-status$ /path/to/server-status.lua
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Installing as a web app\+:}

To install as a plain web-\/app, enable .lua scripts to be handled by mod\+\_\+lua, by adding the following to your appropriate Virtual\+Host configuration\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}AddHandler lua-script .lua
\end{DoxyVerb}


Then just put the {\ttfamily .lua} script somewhere in your document root and visit the page.

\subsection*{Configuring}

There are a few options inside the Lua script that can be set to {\ttfamily true} or {\ttfamily false}\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily show\+\_\+warning}\+: Whether or not to show a notice that this page is there on purpose.
\item {\ttfamily redact\+\_\+ips}\+: Whether or not to replace the last few bits of every IP with \textquotesingle{}x.\+x\textquotesingle{}
\item {\ttfamily show\+\_\+modules}\+: Whether to show the list of loaded modules or not
\item {\ttfamily show\+\_\+threads}\+: Whether to show thread details or not. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
