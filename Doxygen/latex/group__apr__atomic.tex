\end{DoxyReturn}
Escape a path segment, as defined in R\+F\+C1808. 
\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em escaped} & Optional buffer to write the encoded string, can be N\+U\+LL \\
\hline
{\em str} & The original string \\
\hline
{\em slen} & The length of the original string, or A\+P\+R\+\_\+\+E\+S\+C\+A\+P\+E\+\_\+\+S\+T\+R\+I\+NG \\
\hline
{\em len} & If present, returns the length of the string \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
A\+P\+R\+\_\+\+S\+U\+C\+C\+E\+SS, or A\+P\+R\+\_\+\+N\+O\+T\+F\+O\+U\+ND if no changes to the string were detected or the string was N\+U\+LL
\end{DoxyReturn}
Converts an OS path to a U\+RL, in an OS dependent way, as defined in R\+F\+C1808. In all cases if a \textquotesingle{}\+:\textquotesingle{} occurs before the first \textquotesingle{}/\textquotesingle{} in the U\+RL, the U\+RL should be prefixed with \char`\"{}./\char`\"{} (or the \textquotesingle{}\+:\textquotesingle{} escaped). In the case of Unix, this means leaving \textquotesingle{}/\textquotesingle{} alone, but otherwise doing what escape\+\_\+path\+\_\+segment() does. For efficiency reasons, we don\textquotesingle{}t use escape\+\_\+path\+\_\+segment(), which is provided for reference. Again, R\+FC 1808 is where this stuff is defined.

If partial is set, os\+\_\+escape\+\_\+path() assumes that the path will be appended to something with a \textquotesingle{}/\textquotesingle{} in it (and thus does not prefix \char`\"{}./\char`\"{}). 
\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}

\hline
{\em path} & The original string \\

\hline
{\em partial} & If non zero, suppresses the prepending of \char`\"{}./\char`\"{} \\
\hline
{\em len} & If present, returns the length of the string \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}

In the simplest example, given a filepath of \char`\"{}/foo\char`\"{}, returns the rootpath of \char`\"{}/\char`\"{} and filepath points at \char`\"{}foo\char`\"{}. This is far more complex on other platforms, which will canonicalize the root form to a consistant format, given the A\+P\+R\+\_\+\+F\+I\+L\+E\+P\+A\+T\+H\+\_\+\+T\+R\+U\+E\+N\+A\+ME flag, and also test for the validity of that root (e.\+g., that a drive d\+:/ or network share //machine/foovol/). The function returns A\+P\+R\+\_\+\+E\+R\+E\+L\+A\+T\+I\+VE if filepath isn\textquotesingle{}t rooted (an error), A\+P\+R\+\_\+\+E\+I\+N\+C\+O\+M\+P\+L\+E\+TE if the root path is ambiguous (but potentially legitimate, e.\+g. \char`\"{}/\char`\"{} on Windows is incomplete because it doesn\textquotesingle{}t specify the drive letter), or A\+P\+R\+\_\+\+E\+B\+A\+D\+P\+A\+TH if the root is simply invalid. A\+P\+R\+\_\+\+S\+U\+C\+C\+E\+SS is returned if filepath is an absolute path.

The only reason that the apr\+\_\+file\+\_\+open\+\_\+std$\ast$ functions exist is that you may not always have a stderr/out/in on Windows. This is generally a problem with newer versions of Windows and services.

The other problem is that the C library functions generally work differently on Windows and Unix. So, by using apr\+\_\+file\+\_\+open\+\_\+std$\ast$ functions, you can get a handle to an A\+PR struct that works with the A\+PR functions which are supposed to work identically on all platforms.

\item 
\begin{DoxyPre}\%pF same as above, but takes a apr\_off\_t *\end{DoxyPre}

\item 
\begin{DoxyPre}\%pS same as above, but takes a apr\_size\_t *\end{DoxyPre}

\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyPre}\%pA, \%pI, \%pT, \%pp are available from APR 1.0.0 onwards (and in 0.9.x).
\%pt is only available from APR 1.2.0 onwards.
\%pm, \%pB, \%pF and \%pS are only available from APR 1.3.0 onwards.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}The \%p hacks are to force gcc's printf warning code to skip
over a pointer argument without complaining.  This does
mean that the ANSI-style \%p (output a void * in hex format) won't
work as expected at all, but that seems to be a fair trade-off
for the increased robustness of having printf-warnings work.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}Additionally, apr\_vformatter allows for arbitrary output methods
using the apr\_vformatter\_buff and flush\_func.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}The apr\_vformatter\_buff has two elements curpos and endpos.
curpos is where apr\_vformatter will write the next byte of output.
It proceeds writing output to curpos, and updating curpos, until
either the end of output is reached, or curpos == endpos (i.e. the
buffer is full).\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}If the end of output is reached, apr\_vformatter returns the
number of bytes written.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}When the buffer is full, the flush\_func is called.  The flush\_func
can return -1 to indicate that no further output should be attempted,
and apr\_vformatter will return immediately with -1.  Otherwise
the flush\_func should flush the buffer in whatever manner is
appropriate, re \hyperlink{structapr__pool__t}{apr\_pool\_t} nitialize curpos and endpos, and return 0.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}Note that flush\_func is only invoked as a result of attempting to
write another byte at curpos when curpos >= endpos.  So for
example, it's possible when the output exactly matches the buffer
space available that curpos == endpos will be true when
apr\_vformatter returns.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}apr\_vformatter does not call out to any other code, it is entirely
self-contained.  This allows the callers to do things which are
otherwise "unsafe".  For example, apr\_psprintf uses the "scratch"
space at the unallocated end of a block, and doesn't actually
complete the allocation until apr\_vformatter returns.  apr\_psprintf
would be completely broken if apr\_vformatter were to call anything
that used this same pool.  Similarly http\_bprintf() uses the "scratch"
space at the end of its output buffer, and doesn't actually note
that the space is in use until it either has to flush the buffer
or until apr\_vformatter returns.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Thread library implementations commonly use a \char`\"{}guard area\char`\"{} after each thread\textquotesingle{}s stack which is not readable or writable such that stack overflows cause a segfault; this consumes e.\+g. 4K of memory and increases memory management overhead. Setting the guard area size to zero hence trades off reliable behaviour on stack overflow for performance.

Converts an OS path to a U\+RL, in an OS dependent way, as defined in R\+F\+C1808. In all cases if a \textquotesingle{}\+:\textquotesingle{} occurs before the first \textquotesingle{}/\textquotesingle{} in the U\+RL, the U\+RL should be prefixed with \char`\"{}./\char`\"{} (or the \textquotesingle{}\+:\textquotesingle{} escaped). In the case of Unix, this means leaving \textquotesingle{}/\textquotesingle{} alone, but otherwise doing what escape\+\_\+path\+\_\+segment() does. For efficiency reasons, we don\textquotesingle{}t use escape\+\_\+path\+\_\+segment(), which is provided for reference. Again, R\+FC 1808 is where this stuff is defined.

If partial is set, os\+\_\+escape\+\_\+path() assumes that the path will be appended to something with a \textquotesingle{}/\textquotesingle{} in it (and thus does not prefix \char`\"{}./\char`\"{}).

\begin{DoxyRemark}{Remarks}
on return, filepath points to the first non-\/root character in the given filepath. In the simplest example, given a filepath of \char`\"{}/foo\char`\"{}, returns the rootpath of \char`\"{}/\char`\"{} and filepath points at \char`\"{}foo\char`\"{}. This is far more complex on other platforms, which will canonicalize the root form to a consistant format, given the A\+P\+R\+\_\+\+F\+I\+L\+E\+P\+A\+T\+H\+\_\+\+T\+R\+U\+E\+N\+A\+ME flag, and also test for the validity of that root (e.\+g., that a drive d\+:/ or network share //machine/foovol/). The function returns A\+P\+R\+\_\+\+E\+R\+E\+L\+A\+T\+I\+VE if filepath isn\textquotesingle{}t rooted (an error), A\+P\+R\+\_\+\+E\+I\+N\+C\+O\+M\+P\+L\+E\+TE if the root path is ambiguous (but potentially legitimate, e.\+g. \char`\"{}/\char`\"{} on Windows is incomplete because it doesn\textquotesingle{}t specify the drive letter), or A\+P\+R\+\_\+\+E\+B\+A\+D\+P\+A\+TH if the root is simply invalid. A\+P\+R\+\_\+\+S\+U\+C\+C\+E\+SS is returned if filepath is an absolute path.

The only reason that the apr\+\_\+file\+\_\+open\+\_\+std$\ast$ functions exist is that you may not always have a stderr/out/in on Windows. This is generally a problem with newer versions of Windows and services.

The other problem is that the C library functions generally work differently on Windows and Unix. So, by using apr\+\_\+file\+\_\+open\+\_\+std$\ast$ functions, you can get a handle to an A\+PR struct that works with the A\+PR functions which are supposed to work identically on all platforms.

string (from apr\_strerror) corresponding to that error code.\end{DoxyPre}

\item 
\begin{DoxyPre}\%pp takes a void * and outputs it in hex\end{DoxyPre}

\item 
\begin{DoxyPre}\%pB takes a apr\_uint32\_t * as bytes and outputs it's apr\_strfsize\end{DoxyPre}

\item 
\begin{DoxyPre}\%pF same as above, but takes a apr\_off\_t *\end{DoxyPre}

\item 
\begin{DoxyPre}\%pS same as above, but takes a apr\_size\_t *\end{DoxyPre}

\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyPre}\%pA, \%pI, \%pT, \%pp are available from APR 1.0.0 onwards (and in 0.9.x).
\%pt is only available from APR 1.2.0 onwards.
\%pm, \%pB, \%pF and \%pS are only available from APR 1.3.0 onwards.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}The \%p hacks are to force gcc's printf warning code to skip
over a pointer argument without complaining.  This does
mean that the ANSI-style \%p (output a void * in hex format) won't
work as expected at all, but that seems to be a fair trade-off
for the increased robustness of having printf-warnings work.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}Additionally, apr\_vformatter allows for arbitrary output methods
using the apr\_vformatter\_buff and flush\_func.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}The apr\_vformatter\_buff has two elements curpos and endpos.
curpos is where apr\_vformatter will write the next byte of output.
It proceeds writing output to curpos, and updating curpos, until
either the end of output is reached, or curpos == endpos (i.e. the
buffer is full).\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}If the end of output is reached, apr\_vformatter returns the
number of bytes written.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}When the buffer is full, the flush\_func is called.  The flush\_func
can return -1 to indicate that no further output should be attempted,
and apr\_vformatter will return immediately with -1.  Otherwise
the flush\_func should flush the buffer in whatever manner is
appropriate, re \hyperlink{structapr__pool__t}{apr\_pool\_t} nitialize curpos and endpos, and return 0.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}Note that flush\_func is only invoked as a result of attempting to
write another byte at curpos when curpos >= endpos.  So for
example, it's possible when the output exactly matches the buffer
space available that curpos == endpos will be true when
apr\_vformatter returns.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}apr\_vformatter does not call out to any other code, it is entirely
self-contained.  This allows the callers to do things which are
otherwise "unsafe".  For example, apr\_psprintf uses the "scratch"
space at the unallocated end of a block, and doesn't actually
complete the allocation until apr\_vformatter returns.  apr\_psprintf
would be completely broken if apr\_vformatter were to call anything
that used this same pool.  Similarly http\_bprintf() uses the "scratch"
space at the end of its output buffer, and doesn't actually note
that the space is in use until it either has to flush the buffer
or until apr\_vformatter returns.

The data to be attached to the pool should have a life span at least as long as the pool it is being attached to.
\end{DoxyWarning}
Users of A\+PR must take E\+X\+T\+R\+E\+ME care when choosing a key to use for their data. It is possible to accidentally overwrite data by choosing a key that another part of the program is using. Therefore it is advised that steps are taken to ensure that unique keys are used for all of the userdata objects in a particular pool (the same key in two different pools or a pool and one of its subpools is okay) at all times. Careful namespace prefixing of key names is a typical way to help ensure this uniqueness.

\end{DoxyNote}
\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
This should N\+OT be used if the key could change addresses by any means between the apr\+\_\+pool\+\_\+userdata\+\_\+setn() call and a subsequent apr\+\_\+pool\+\_\+userdata\+\_\+get() on that key, such as if a static string is used as a userdata key in a D\+SO and the D\+SO could be unloaded and reloaded between the \+\_\+setn() and the \+\_\+get(). You M\+U\+ST use apr\+\_\+pool\+\_\+userdata\+\_\+set() in such cases. 

More generally, the key and the data to be attached to the pool should have a life span at least as long as the pool itself.

\end{DoxyRemark}
Put the active calling thread to sleep until signaled to wake up or the timeout is reached. Each condition variable must be associated with a mutex, and that mutex must be locked before calling this function, or the behavior will be undefined. As the calling thread is put to sleep, the given mutex will be simultaneously released; and as this thread wakes up the lock is again simultaneously acquired.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Thread library implementations commonly use a \char`\"{}guard area\char`\"{} after each thread\textquotesingle{}s stack which is not readable or writable such that stack overflows cause a segfault; this consumes e.\+g. 4K of memory and increases memory management overhead. Setting the guard area size to zero hence trades off reliable behaviour on stack overflow for performance.
